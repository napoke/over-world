   <h1>What about Belgium?</h1>

   <h2>Where is Belgium?</h2>
     <p>Belgium, which is known for medieval towns, Renaissance architecture and as headquarters of the European Union and NATO, is located in northwestern Europe, which is part of the European Union.
        It borders on Germany, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Official Name: Kingdom of Belgium</p>
     <p>Although its surface area of 30,688 km2 makes it a small country, its location has made it the economic and urban nerve centre of Europe.</p>

     <h2 class="facts">How is the weather?</h2>
     <p>Belgium has a temperate maritime climate characterized by moderate temperatures, prevailing southerly to westerly winds, abundant cloud cover and frequent precipitation. Summers are relatively cool and humid and winters relatively mild and rainy.</p>
     <p>The annual mean temperature is around 50 °F (10 °C). Brussels, which is roughly in the middle of the country, has a mean minimum temperature of just below 32 °F (0 °C) in January and a mean maximum of about 71 °F (22 °C) in July.</p>

     <h2 class="facts">Political system</h2>
     <p>According to the EU (European Union), Belgium is a federal constitutional monarchy in which the king is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government in a multi-party system. Decision-making powers are not centralised, but divided between 3 levels of government: the federal government, 3 language-based communities (Flemish, French and German-speaking) and 3 regions (Flanders, Brussels Capital and Wallonia). Legally they all are equal, but have powers and responsibilities for different fields. Brussels is, together with Luxembourg City and Strasbourg, one of the three official seats of the European institutions.</p>
