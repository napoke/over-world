 <h1>The magic of Belgium<h1>
 <h2>What language do they speak?</h2>
 <p>Belgium is composed of four language areas: the Dutch language area, the French language area, the German language area (9 municipalities in the east of Belgium) and the bilingual Brussels-Capital area. This subdivision into language areas and official languages does by no means detract from the language freedom.</p>

 <h2 class="h">Holidays</h2>
 <h3 class="BN">Belgian National Day</h3>
 <p>Belgian National Day commemorates an event that occurred July 21, 1831. On that day, Leopold of Saxe-Cobourg swore allegiance to the new Belgian Constitution and became the first King of the Belgians. The king's vow marked the start of the independent state of Belgium under a constitutional monarchy and parliament.</p>
